    Item of Choice: **Extra Spicy Fried Chicken**
    

    Address: **6101 Telegraph Ave Oakland, CA 94609**


    If I am going to get fried chicken, I want to get this fried chicken.  Fried chicken hits the spot plus OB Town has a ton of great flavors to choose from!  This place is great for small parties and to share food.  The plates are huge but you will definitely feel full from eating the entire plate!  If you want other foods to try, the Dduk Bok Ki, Cheese Corn, and the Seafood Pancake go well with the chicken!


    **TIPS**
    Happy hour has good discount prices!  The plates are huge, sharing a plate is advised.  Get half one flavor and half the other!  More flavors for the same price.

    Item of Choice: **Hangover Omlette**
    

    Address: **2498 Telegraph Ave Berkeley, CA 94704**


    They also got some good brunch here!  At such a convenient location near campus, this is a perfect place after a long night of drinking.  In particular, their hashbrowns have a great balance of crunchy!  I have definitely had their hangover omlette more times than I should've!

       So who does not like fried dough drenched in powdered sugar?  But besides the Beignets, there is some great Cajun food here!  I also really like the Shrimp Creole.  The lighting is great at night and a good place for dates. 
    

    **TIPS**
    You are probably going to have to call in for a reservation

# Berkeley & Telegraph Ave

Berkeley definitely has a ton of character.  Stressed students to street vendors to the Hell Yeah Guy and the Chainz Car, Berkeley has its share of interesting people.  Berkeley has some great things to do and places to eat!

  {% include gallery id="bart_map"%}

You're probably coming from Oakland International Airport, making use of BART is a great, convenient way of getting around the bay.  Take the AirBART to get to the Coliseum BART station and you're on your way to visiting the bay!  If you're coming straight to Berkeley, take the Richmond bound train and get off at the Downtown Berkeley Bart station.


If you really need to get somewhere that isn't walking distance, you can always take the AC Transit bus, the 51B will take you right down College Ave and the 6 will take you down Telegraph Avenue.  Uber and Lyft are always around so it is just a quick call to get from place to place. Although, depending on your stay, you can still do a ton of things without venturing too far from campus!
