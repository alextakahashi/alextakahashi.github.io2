# Occupation: Not a Student Anymore
Recent grad here, and I'm happy to say I made it in one piece!  I graduated from the institution that is UC Berkeley.  My college experience has given me well deserved all nighters, greuling projects, and stressful procrastination gaming/netflix sessions, but I have made it out and I can now proudly call myself a Berkeley Engineering Alumni!

Yup, sometimes Berkeley really does make you want to pull your hair out and scream! (But I usually do it in the comfort of my own home or the basement of our Computer Science Building).  I have never been more challenged, more frustrated, or more gasping for air at the slightest opportunity than here at this lovely place called CAL.  But, at the same time, I haven't made such loving friendships, vivid memories, or amazing experiences anywhere else than my home, Berkeley! I can't get enough of this place, so I am staying an extra year here post grad.

If you're interested, checkout some of my reflections about my college experience below.  Otherwise just shamelessly look at my grad pictures.

# Who is That Boy I See Staring Straight Back at Me
Yeah, you won't be the same person coming into college as the person coming out of college.  Things I have noticed about myself in comparison to my high school self:
* More Confidence
* More Drive
* More Naps
* More Caffeine
* Less Sanity

I'm not that sheltered kid I was coming into this school anymore!  You know that person your parent's tell you to be careful of?  The one that will dare you to do somthing dumb just for the sake of your own pride?  Well, I'm that guy now.  Please friends, do questionable / nonquestionable things responsibly!

Berkeley changes you.  I come home and my parents say, "Wow, Alex, you've become so Liberal".  But, they haven't seen anything like the intensity of Berkely Protests.  I have become more socially and politically aware of current events at the student government level all the way up to world events.  It has definitely been an eye opening experience to see how people think!
