So I've always wanted to get into photography.  You see people's fancy pictures on instagram or the latest trending photo on reddit, and I have the smallest hopes of making something half as good as what they have created. Keep in mind I have never actually gotten down to the nitty gritty of how photography works.  The best I've gotten was playing with an iPhone and slapping on an instagram filter (Shoutout to my favorites Ludwig, Juno, and Mayfair).  Of course, it's the skill that makes the photographer, not the equipment.  Hopefully I can move from just taking random pictures on my phone to actually developing some quality shoots.

I've decided to pick up a camera and try my hand at a new hobby plus to document more of my life in some sense.  Yesterday, I purchased an [Olympus E-M10 Mark II](http://www.getolympus.com/us/en/e-m10-mark-ii.html "Olympus Site") at a local photography store.  Thankfully my photography expert friend was able to guide me and give me his recommendations! Talking with the experts at the store, I barely understood the jargon they threw around.  Guess it's time to hit the books and start learning!

I ended up trying to take photos.  Look at this photo I couldn't get to focus.  It's supposed to be a flower...
