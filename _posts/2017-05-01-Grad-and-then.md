# Occupation: Not a Student Anymore
Recent grad here, and I'm happy to say I made it in one piece!  I graduated from the institution that is UC Berkeley.  My college experience has given me well deserved all nighters, greuling projects, and stressful procrastination gaming/netflix sessions, but I have made it out and I can now proudly call myself a Berkeley Engineering Alumni!

Yup, sometimes Berkeley really does make you want to pull your hair out and scream! (But I usually do it in the comfort of my own home or the basement of our Computer Science Building).  I have never been more challenged, more frustrated, or more gasping for air at the slightest opportunity than here at this lovely place called CAL.  But, at the same time, I haven't made such loving friendships, vivid memories, or amazing experiences anywhere else than my home, Berkeley! 

If you're interested, checkout some of my reflections about my college experience below.  Otherwise just shamelessly look at my grad pictures.

# Friends Who Kept Me Sane
Berkely is hard, friends make it better!  These are some of my closest friends; look at us pose awkwardly.

# Me, but 4 Years Later and Not as Dorky (?)
Yeah, I definitely wasn't the same person coming into college as the person coming out of college.  Things I have noticed about myself in comparison to my high school self:
* More Confidence
* More Liberal
* More Naps
* More Caffeine
* Less Sanity

I'm not that sheltered kid I was coming into this school anymore!  You know that person your parent's tell you to be careful of?  The one that will dare you to do somthing dumb just for the sake of your own pride?  Well, I'm that guy now.  Please friends, do questionable / nonquestionable things responsibly!  But if you're going to do anything questionable, please let me snap it.

# Reflctions & Insights
* Berkeley is the best school, like, ever.  Except sometimes it might feel like your brain is on fire, and your problem sets are on fire, and the school is on fire, and everything is on fire üî•
* Literally, no one cares.  You can do anything you want (within legal limits) and no one is going to stop you from doing you.  Just do you.
* Don't take yourself so seriously.  Nothing like some grade A self depricating humor to lighten up the mood.
* Make your own decisions, otherwise people will make them for you.
* Fail often, fail early, fail cheap.
* Don't be a little bitch, just shut up and do it.

# Bye Berkeley, but Not Really
Berkeley and I have a complex relationship - lots of love hate going on.  But, I can't get enough of this place, so I am actually staying an extra year here post grad. All in all Berkeley, I'd like to leave you with two firey middle fingers up in the air, but my friend works it way better than I ever could.  Peace.
