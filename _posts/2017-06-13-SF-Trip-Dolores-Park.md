    Item of Choice: **Stawberry Matcha Latte**
    

    Address: **3491 19th St, San Francisco, CA 94110**


    Right off the bat, this drink looks a lot more interesting than a regular old Boba Milk Tea.  Introducing the Strawberry Matcha Latte!  Please do everyone a favor and remember to mix your drink but don't forget to take a shameless snapchat / instagram boomerang post.  This place can have quite the line, plan ahead for a wait!  Sip your drink right on the park lawn.  Oh yeah they aren't open on Mondays...


    **TIPS**
    Long Lines!

    Address: **3692 18th St, San Francisco, CA 94110**


    Yo they got some really good icecream for anyone with a sweet tooth.  The line completely wrapped around the corner and we had to wait 30 minutes, but it was worth the wait!  I was at first skeptical of the cream cheese icecream, but it turned out to be a very pleasant surprise!  Carrot Cake chunks were delicious paired with the ice cream!  Originally I just got the mlik chocolate icecream as an aftertought becuase my order came with two flavors.  I bit into icecream that had the texture of crushed M&Ms and it was wonderful.  Each icecream scoop was the perfect consistency and hit the spot for the hot but windy day.  I also got the waffle bowl, but I'd probably just stick to the cone!


    **TIPS**
    Long Lines!

    Item of Choice: **Carne Asada Super Nachos**
    

    Address: **697 Valencia St, San Francisco, CA 941100**


    To be honest, I didn't actually get the Carne Asada Super Nachos, but the family behind me did and I immediately regret my decision to get the Carne Asada Super Burrito.  Although, once I tasted it, it was delicious!  My friend couldn't believe that there was good Mexican food outside of SoCal, but this proved her wrong.  (She also hasn't traveled much out of SoCal anyway - her loss).  This was a fat burrito and was hard to finish in one sitting!  At a very decent price for SF standards, I'm coming back here.

      Item of Choice: **Beef House Noodles**


      Address: **3406 18th St, San Francisco, CA 94110**


        If you want to enjoy food while feeling intimidated by the chef herself, Yamo is the place.  I went with friends my first time, and they explicitly warned me of the Tiger Mom.  She didn't fall short of her expectations - she runs a tight ship!  NO PICTURES!.  There was an odd contradiction of great food paired with mild discomfort from the chef's demeanor but not an absolute turn off and will not stop me from sitting quitely at the table once again.
    

    **TIPS**
    Arrive as soon as they open!  Literally only 8 bar stools.  Wait patiently at the door for you to be called in.  Please let the woman do her business otherwise you might get a rude welcome!  **CASH ONLY**

    Not going to lie, but I have not actually been here yet!  But, I have heard from enough of my friends that their brunch is top notch!  Their plating is aesthetic af and worth the shameless instagram post.  When I come back to Dolores Park this is going to be my brunch spot of choice!

# A Day Trip at Dolores Park

If you're looking for a day trip, check out Dolores Park! There is a ton of culture here - this is a place you can wander around, eat a ton, and a place just to take a breather and relax.  Literally bring your towel and plant yourself anywhere on the grass.  People can be seen throwing frisbees, chillin with their dogs, playing Beer Pong, smoking Weed, you name it a ton of things.  The times I've been here, I've seen people doing the more interesting things like tight rope walking and silent disco!  Anyway, apart from the park, below are a few of the spots I've been to and would recommend to anyone spending the day out here!
