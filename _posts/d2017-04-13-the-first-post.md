Hello :wave: to anyone who just so happened to be looking at this janky blog,

So if you don't know me, I'm Alex and this coming May I will be **officially**, *arbitrarily* becoming an adult.  My college days are coming to an end and I will be entering the next chapter of my life trying to be self sustaining and learn how take care of myself as an independent.  Let's just hope life doesn't tumble into something like this:

## Q. So Alex, why are you making this blog all of a sudden?
A. To document more of my life.  Plus I figured everyone needs their own personal website / blog.  Why not start one right out of college.  

## Q. What do you plan to do with your blog?
A. Put a random assortment of things.  It's hard to say. Check out the list below for starters...

Look at all these cool totally radical things I say I am going to do, but may actually never follow up on!

# Blog Reach Goals
* Document Fitness Progress / Advice About Lifiting
* Picture Portfolio
* Today I Learned
* Recommendations
* Current Side Projects

Watch me struggle through my daily life and we will see how life just so happens to turn out for me.
