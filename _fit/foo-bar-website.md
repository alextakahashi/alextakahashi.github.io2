> "Most Likely to Overdose on Workout Supplements"

On my college Dragon Boat Team, I was voted most likely to overdose on workout supplements.  I'd like to thank my liver for being the MVP and keeping my body as clean as it could possibly be.  If you haven't seen me at the RSF, I'm the guy who always wears the Pokemon tank top.

I've clocked in a ton of hours at the gym ever since I started lifting casually Freshman year of college and seriously Junior year.  My lifting and body hit its all time peak the summer before Senior year until I had a pretty serious back injury bringing it to a sudden stop.

After months of some rough recovery, I'm back at the gym!  It's not a great feeling to lose all your progress, but I'm happy to be back at my favorite place.  Check out some of my posts for my daily fitness logs as well as my Quick-Start Guide to Lifting!

Catch me at the gym yo.

# A Guide

In all seriousness, here is a guide of what has worked for me in the past.  Here are a couple stats during my peak:

## Peak Fitness Stats

| Stats | Value |
|:------:|:----------------:|
| Weight | 166 lbs |
| Bench Press | 205 lbs |
| Squat | 315 lbs |
| DeadLift | 315 lbs |
| Mile Run | 6:13 |

I was on and off tracking my progress, moving from a physical notepad / journal, to an app, and back.  According to my [Bodyspace](https://bodyspace.bodybuilding.com/alextakahashi), while I was using the app, I've clocked in 91 workouts and lifted almost 2,000,000 lbs!  Hopefully this at least proves that my workouts have shown results!

Failure played a huge part in how I learned how to lift.  I've made mistakes, bad form, injuries, and inconsistency, but all these experiences have made me a stronger lifter in the long run!  Please, learn from my mistakes and jump start your lifting.

I hope this guide can get anyone who is interested in lifting or wants to make a fitness life style change confident enough to have a plan and hit the gym!
