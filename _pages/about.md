# Hi Friends, I'm Alex
### I guess I do computer things.  Definitely learn the most important facts about me below:

## Totally Radical, Absolutely Astounding, and Interesting Facts About Alex

  * Alex will arbitrarily become an adult after he graduates UC Berkeley in May 2017.  UPDATE: He has graduated.
  * He will receive a B.S. in Bioengineering and instead of pursuing graduate school like his more talented BioE counterparts he will instead bang his head on his keyboard as a Code Monkey.  (JK Software Engineering is hard as hell, and Alex secretly loves it)
  * He received the Most Stressed Award not once, but twice at his high school.  Subsequently, Alex became even more stressed.
  * If you haven’t met him yet, don’t be alarmed.  The excessive CAPITALIZATION isn’t “necessarily” him yelling.  Many people have drawn parallels with Alex and the Student Athlete Meme.
  * While he is not slaving away at his computer, Alex likes to lift heavy objects and put them back on the ground at the gym.  He named his left bicep “No Pizza” and his right bicep “No Ice cream”.  This has not worked out for him or his biceps.
  * Alex has a twin!  Before you ask, SHE is NOT his identical twin.  Look how much Alex's sisters enjoy hanging out with him.

  * Dark Humor is staple in Alex’s diet.  He enjoys imagining unrealistic and offensive scenarios and is very glad no one can actively read his mind.
  * Alex’s has done a major dishonor to his Japanese heritage - despite being 100% Japanese, he does not like sushi.  His friends remind him to commit sudoku when they hit the sushi bars.
  * If you ask what Alex is listening to, it is usually something really trashy.  Alex likes listening to trap music.  If you ask him “What song?” or “Which DJ?”, He actually doesn’t know.  The best you’ll get from him is some awkward humming.
  * Alex really has absolutely no idea how to deal with kids.  His opener goes something along the line of … “Oh… so… do you like math?”  He once tried to hold his baby cousin, but had a mild freak out and gave her back to her dad as fast as possible.
  * Alex prefers dogs to children.  His dream is to have two dogs.  A small, derpy pupperino named Socrates and a large, wise woofer named Potatoe.
