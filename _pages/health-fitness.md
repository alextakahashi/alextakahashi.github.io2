On my college Dragon Boat Team, I was voted most likely to overdose on workout supplements.  I'd like to thank my liver for being the MVP and keeping my body as clean as it could possibly be.  If you haven't seen me at the RSF, I'm the guy who always wears the Pokemon tank top.

I've clocked in hundreds of hours at the gym ever since I started lifting casually Freshman year of college and seriously Junior year.  My lifting and body hit its all time peak the summer before Senior year until I had a pretty serious back injury bringing it to a sudden stop.

After months of some rough recovery, I'm back at the gym!  It's not a great feeling to lose all your progress, but I'm happy to be back at my favorite place.  Check out some of my posts for my daily fitness logs as well as my Quick-Start Guide to Lifting!

Catch me at the gym yo.
